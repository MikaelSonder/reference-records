    <p>
      Visa processing encompasses administrative procedures associated with the
      assessment and issuance of entry and residence permissions within a defined
      jurisdiction, where legal basis and administrative discretion intersect.
    </p>

    <p>
      In Portugal, such procedures are situated within national immigration
      frameworks and prevailing administrative practice applicable at the time
      of application.
