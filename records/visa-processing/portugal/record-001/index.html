      <h2>Residence Visa and Permit Processing under Portuguese Administrative Practice</h2>

    <section>
      <h3>Scope of Application</h3>
      <p>
        This record concerns the administrative processing of residence visas and
        residence permits within Portuguese territory, as applied through consular
        issuance and subsequent domestic administrative handling.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the purposes of this record, <em>visa processing</em> refers to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>the transition between consular visa issuance and in-country residence permit procedures</li>
        <li>administrative handling by Portuguese immigration authorities following lawful entry</li>
        <li>procedural requirements arising from residence-based legal grounds</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This record does <strong>not</strong> address:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>short-stay Schengen visas</li>
        <li>border control procedures</li>
        <li>nationality or naturalisation processes</li>
        <li>judicial review of administrative acts</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Administrative Reality and Formal Framework</h3>
      <p>
        Formally, residence visa issuance occurs through Portuguese consular services
        abroad, followed by residence permit processing under the authority of the
        national immigration administration.
      </p>
      <p>
        In practice, responsibility for residence permit processing has been affected
        by the institutional transition from SEF to AIMA, resulting in:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>redistribution of case handling across regional administrative units</li>
        <li>procedural delays not explicitly reflected in statutory timelines</li>
        <li>variance in document handling and appointment scheduling</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        While the legal framework governing residence permits is nationally uniform,
        administrative practice is materially influenced by:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>regional office capacity</li>
        <li>internal procedural directives</li>
        <li>transitional arrangements following institutional restructuring</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Functional Distinction within Processing</h3>
      <p>
        Within Portuguese administrative practice, a distinction is observed between:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>visa issuance as a condition for lawful entry</li>
        <li>residence permit processing as an ongoing administrative relationship</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This distinction has operational consequences, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>differing evidentiary thresholds at consular versus domestic stages</li>
        <li>non-alignment between formally issued visas and subsequent residence permit requirements</li>
        <li>procedural discontinuities where initial visa grounds are reassessed in-country</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Boundary Conditions</h3>
      <p>
        The scope of this record excludes situations where:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>residence rights arise directly under EU free movement provisions</li>
        <li>permits are issued exclusively on humanitarian or exceptional grounds</li>
        <li>processing authority is transferred to judicial or quasi-judicial bodies</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Where residence status is maintained through renewal rather than initial
        issuance, only administrative practice directly affecting continuity of
        residence is considered within scope.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Temporal Fixation</h3>
      <p>
        This record reflects Portuguese administrative practice as observed at the
        time of publication.
      </p>
      <p>
        No assumptions are made regarding future institutional arrangements,
        procedural reforms, or regulatory amendments.
