    <p>
      Visa processing encompasses administrative procedures associated with the
      assessment and issuance of entry and residence permissions within a defined
      jurisdiction, where legal basis and administrative discretion intersect.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the context of Portugal, such procedures are situated within national
      immigration frameworks and prevailing administrative practice applicable
      at the time of application.
