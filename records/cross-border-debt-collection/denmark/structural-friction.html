    <h2>Structural Friction</h2>

    <p>
      <span class="analytic-label">Entry point:</span>
      Structural friction in Swedish debt collection emerges once a claim encounters
      formal objection or evidentiary scrutiny. At that point, progression becomes
      strictly documentation-driven and procedurally bound.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="analytic-label">Required basis:</span>
      The creditor bears full responsibility for establishing the legal basis of the
      claim. Contractual clarity, invoice traceability, delivery confirmation, and
      internal consistency of the record determine procedural viability.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="analytic-label">Time structure:</span>
      Response periods and review stages are fixed by statute. Procedural sequencing
      does not compress in response to urgency, payment pressure, or commercial
      escalation.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="analytic-label">Formal shift:</span>
      Any debtor objection, regardless of scope or perceived merit, redirects the
      matter from administrative handling into formal judicial examination under
      standard evidentiary rules.
    </p>

    <p class="emphasis">
      Within the Swedish framework, outcomes are governed less by recovery tactics
      and more by alignment with formal requirements and system timing.
    </p>

    <div class="system-note">
      System-note: Structural friction arises where objection-driven formal review,
      fixed procedural timelines, and non-negotiable documentation requirements
      intersect, preventing external acceleration from altering progression.
    </div>

    <div class="part-label">PART II — EXPECTATION BOUNDARIES</div>
    <h2>Operational Compatibility</h2>

    <p>
      <span class="analytic-label">Typical misunderstanding:</span>
      External creditors often assume that uncontested administrative progression
      represents the default path. In practice, resistance is common and immediately
      reclassifies the matter as a formal legal dispute.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="analytic-label">Cost structure:</span>
      Cost accumulation follows procedural progression rather than outcome. Legal
      fees, court charges, and enforcement-related expenses arise at defined stages
      and are not offset by accelerated strategy.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="analytic-label">System limits:</span>
      The system does not adjust for urgency, commercial importance, or creditor
      preference. Procedural requirements apply uniformly regardless of context
      or strategic intent.
    </p>

    <p class="emphasis">
      This environment primarily accommodates organizations prepared to treat debt
      enforcement as a regulated legal process rather than a discretionary recovery
      tool.
    </p>

    <!-- PART III -->
    <div class="part-label">PART III — RECORDED PROFESSIONAL PRESENCE</div>
    <h2>Structurally Compatible Actors</h2>

    <p>
      This reference records professional actors whose operating models align with
      the structural constraints governing cross-border debt collection within the
      Swedish system.
    </p>

    <p>
      Recorded presence reflects documented professional activity identifiable at
      the time of publication and implies operational compatibility with the
      conditions described above.
    </p>

    <p class="emphasis">
      Inclusion does not constitute ranking, endorsement, recommendation, or
      comparative assessment. This reference functions as a structural filter,
      not a promotional directory.
    </p>

    <div class="recorded">
      <h3>Recorded Professional Presence</h3>
      <p>No structurally compatible professional presence recorded at time of publication.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="system-note">
      Inclusion criteria, verification methodology, and revision cadence are
      maintained outside the public record.
