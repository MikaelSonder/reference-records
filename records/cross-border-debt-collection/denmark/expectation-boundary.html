    <h2>Structural Friction & Cost Reality</h2>

    <p>
      Debt enforcement in Denmark is characterized by deliberate procedural pacing.
      Progression through the system is governed by statutory requirements rather than
      commercial urgency.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each enforcement phase introduces defined response periods and review thresholds.
      These intervals are mandatory and cannot be shortened by pressure, escalation,
      or external timelines.
    </p>

    <p>
      Cost exposure is cumulative. Administrative, legal, and enforcement-related costs
      are typically borne by the creditor throughout the process. While certain expenses
      may be recoverable in specific circumstances, each procedural step carries an
      independent financial risk.
    </p>

    <p>
      Attempts to accelerate outcomes often increase friction rather than reduce it.
      Time, cost, and outcome are interdependent variables within a system designed
      to favor legal consistency over speed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Effective engagement with this environment assumes early acceptance of these
      constraints and alignment with them, rather than resistance to their existence.
    </p>

  <!-- PART II -->
  <section>
    <div class="part-label">Part II — Expectation Boundaries</div>
    <h2>Operational Compatibility Thresholds</h2>

    <p>
      Recovering an unpaid invoice in Denmark is rarely fast. The process is structured,
      procedural, and often experienced as patience-testing by international creditors.
      Debtor responses may appear dismissive or provocative, while the system itself
      is commonly perceived as prioritizing debtor protections over creditor urgency.
    </p>

    <p>
      Within the Danish framework, the burden of progression rests with the creditor.
      For a claim to be presumed legally valid, the debtor must either formally acknowledge
      the debt or the creditor must establish its existence through prescribed legal
      measures, supported by adequate documentation and evidence.
    </p>

    <p>
      Debtor objections may arise regardless of their perceived merit. Even objections
      viewed as unfounded can trigger extended procedural sequences, each governed by
      mandatory response periods and formal process rules.
    </p>

    <p>
      Debt collection in this environment assumes proportionality, structure, and
      commercial detachment. Matters driven by urgency, frustration, or informal
      expectations tend to lose viability early in the process.
    </p>

    <p>
      This context primarily serves organizations that treat enforcement as a regulated
      extension of commercial risk management. Isolated disputes, informal arrangements,
      or emotionally charged conflicts rarely align with the operational reality of
      the Danish system.

    <div class="part-label">Part III — Recorded Professional Presence</div>
    <h2>Structurally Compatible Actors</h2>

    <p>
      This record documents professional actors operating within the procedural
      context of cross-border debt collection in Denmark.
    </p>

    <p>
      Presence within this reference reflects documented professional activity
      identifiable at the time of publication and implies operational compatibility
      with the procedural constraints described above.
    </p>

    <p>
      This environment is primarily consulted by international counterparties
      seeking jurisdiction-specific competence rather than ad-hoc recovery.
    </p>

    <p>
      Inclusion does not constitute ranking, endorsement, recommendation, or
      comparative assessment.
