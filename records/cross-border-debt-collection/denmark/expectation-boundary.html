    <h2>Structural Friction & Cost Reality</h2>

    <p>
      Debt enforcement in Denmark is characterized by deliberate procedural pacing.
      Progression through the system is governed by statutory requirements rather than
      commercial urgency.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each enforcement phase introduces defined response periods and review thresholds.
      These intervals are mandatory and cannot be shortened by pressure, escalation,
      or external timelines.
    </p>

    <p>
      Cost exposure is cumulative. Administrative, legal, and enforcement-related costs
      are typically borne by the creditor throughout the process. While certain expenses
      may be recoverable in specific circumstances, each procedural step carries an
      independent financial risk.
    </p>

    <p>
      Attempts to accelerate outcomes often increase friction rather than reduce it.
      Time, cost, and outcome are interdependent variables within a system designed to
      favor legal consistency over speed.
    </p>

    <p class="emphasis">
      Effective engagement assumes early acceptance of these constraints and alignment
      with them, rather than resistance to their existence.
    </p>

    <!-- PART II -->
    <div class="part-label">PART II — EXPECTATION BOUNDARIES</div>
    <h2>Operational Compatibility Thresholds</h2>

    <p>
      Recovering an unpaid invoice in Denmark is rarely fast. The process is structured,
      procedural, and often experienced as patience-testing by international creditors.
      Debtor responses may appear dismissive or provocative, while the system itself is
      commonly perceived as prioritizing debtor protections over creditor urgency.
    </p>

    <p>
      Within the Danish framework, the burden of progression rests with the creditor.
      For a claim to be presumed legally valid, the debtor must either formally acknowledge
      the debt or the creditor must establish its existence through prescribed legal measures,
      supported by adequate documentation and evidence.
    </p>

    <p>
      Debtor objections may arise regardless of their perceived merit. Even objections viewed
      as unfounded can trigger extended procedural sequences, each governed by mandatory
      response periods and formal process rules.
    </p>

    <p>
      Debt collection in this environment assumes proportionality, structure, and commercial
      detachment. Matters driven by urgency, frustration, or informal expectations tend to
      lose viability early in the process.
    </p>

    <p class="emphasis">
      This context primarily serves organizations that treat enforcement as a regulated
      extension of commercial risk management — not as an ad-hoc remedy for individual grievances.
    </p>

    <h2>Structurally Compatible Actors</h2>

    <p>
      This reference documents professional actors whose operating models align with the
      procedural realities of cross-border debt collection in Denmark.
    </p>

    <p>
      Presence within this reference reflects documented professional activity identifiable
      at the time of publication and implies operational compatibility with the constraints
      described above.
    </p>

    <p>
      This environment is primarily consulted by international counterparties seeking
      jurisdiction-specific competence, procedural discipline, and reputational control —
      not general service availability.
    </p>

    <p>
      Practitioners whose work depends on documentation integrity, structured escalation,
      and commercial detachment tend to be structurally compatible with the Danish system.
      Actors accustomed to informal resolution, discretionary pressure, or emotionally
      driven recovery typically encounter persistent friction.
    </p>

    <p class="emphasis">
      Inclusion does not constitute ranking, endorsement, recommendation, or comparative
      assessment. This reference functions as a structural filter, not a promotional directory.
